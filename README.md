# Nashville-Real-Estate-Analysis
This project utilized a dataset with Housing Sales information for property sales in and around the Nashville, TN area. I was inspired to do this project due to my recent interest in the housing market, and it's continuing unaffordability here for many in the city of Toronto. Though a dataset with this particular information didn't exist for Toronto, I was happy to find a dataset that focused in on another major city in North America.

Diving into the project scope, the dataset was first uploaded into SQL and subsequently queried to extract key information. Following the query analysis, a Tableau visualization was created using filtered and queried data to present some of the key findings from the dataset.

Looking into the SQL Queries, the first few queries were utilized to filter and extract information to be later placed into Excel Spreadsheets. About 4-5 spreadsheets were created that represented different findings from the dataset. They were individually uploaded into Tableau to start creating and editing the Visualizations.

The other SQL Queries consisted of seperating data in particular columns into seperate columns. As an example, the property address column initially consisted of the property address and sub-city in Nashville. This was then split into Address and Sub-City columns respectively, and later utilized in the visualizations.

Moving onto the visualization, the following were analyzed:
- Bar graph showcasing the richest owners by sales
- Line (Trend) Plot showcasing Property Value vs. Sale Price in USD
- Bar graph showcasing the Property Value in USD by City Region
- Info Card with Total Value of the Properties in the Dataset and Total Sales made from those properties
- Info Card with Types of Properties

The dataset utilized for this project can be seen in the Data sub-folder of this repository. The Tableau visualization is available on the public website (link provided in file).
